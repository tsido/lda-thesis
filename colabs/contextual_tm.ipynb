It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. We’ve tried to combine realistic flight dynamics with stunning graphics and fun game play: Each landing attempt takes just a few minutes. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\\n\\nNo ads, no in-app-purchases.\\n\\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. Landing the Orbiter takes practice, but the built-in autopilot demo and tutorials will get you started. After your first safe touchdown,  chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different weather conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles. \\n\\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\\n\\nHere’s what others have said about it:\\n\\n“Because this app is so visually exciting, so technically deep, so sophisticated, so beautifully done in its realism, effects, and documentation, it earned a perfect 5/5 rating, Outstanding.”\\nJohn Martellaro, Senior Editor for Reviews, The Mac Observer\\n\\n“I was excited to see that I can enjoy flying the space shuttle realistically also on my iPhone and complement my addiction to our Space Shuttle Mission Simulator on PC when I am on the road.”\\nAlex L., www.space-shuttle-mission.com\\n\\n“Absolutely awesome app that is a must for shuttle huggers and aspiring astronauts.”\\nChris Bergin, Managing Editor, NASASpaceflight.com\\n\\nF-Sim Space Shuttle takes full advantage of modern iOS devices, but also runs smoothly on older hardware.

When a player joins a game, their screen becomes a button which can be tapped to buzz in, sending a wireless signal to the host’s device, which will play a sound and indicate which player buzzed in first. Do you have more players than iOS devices? No problem! Up to four players can use the same device to buzz in.

All of this enables you to give the players of your game an exciting and immersive experience!\\n\\nSome sound effects play automatically throughout the game so that you, the host, can concentrate on keeping up a fast-paced game. Whenever a player buzzes in, for instance, a sound is played, providing immediate feedback to the host and the players.\\n\\nIf you connect the host’s device to an external display (like an Apple TV), you can show game information to all the players in the room. The display includes the names of all players of each team, the score of each team, and the customizable timer that counts down when a player buzzes in. This also makes it easy for everyone in the room to see who buzzed in first. While this adds even more to the complete “Studio” effect, an external display is not required; all of this information is also displayed on the host's device.\\n\\nGameplay\\nYou can customize gameplay in many different ways. Teams can be arranged in a variety of ways, to allow many different styles of play.\\n\\nOther customizable features include:\\n- Number of points awarded for correct answers,\\n- Number of points taken away for incorrect answers (zero is an option),\\n- Amount of time a player has to answer a question after buzzing in, and\\n- The color of each team (represented both on the host’s device and on an optional external display).\\n\\nCost\\nDownloading Game Show Studio is free. Players can join games for free. In order to support the developer of the app, hosting a game requires an In-App Purchase. You will have an opportunity to try all the hosting features before you buy.

Sticker, sticker!\" *** Martin, beta-tester, 3 years.\\n\\nWe at 22learn understand that each child develops at his or her own pace and has unique needs, the application, therefore, allows parents / teachers both to modify the maximum number of colored objects (1-10) the child will be choosing from and the targeted educational content in a form of particular colors to be learned (blue, red, yellow, green, orange, pink, purple, black, white, grey, and brown). In this way, the application can be tailored to suit the needs of precisely your child!\\nTo make the game more engaging, the child\\'s task is to place an object (various toys etc.) of a particular color into a train. After each level accomplished (three objects correctly placed into the train), the child can choose a sticker as a reward.\\n\\n*** \"Yeah, green! Got a sticker!\" *** Adam, beta-tester, 3.5 years.\\n\\nFor further reinforcement of motivation to learn in a stimulating and friendly environment, the monkey character is there always ready to enthusiastically praise children for all their efforts. Children will love the monkey jumping out of joy accompanied by fun sound effects when they get a correct response!\\nMoreover, the game keeps children challenged as it gets progressively more difficult after each level -- the number of objects to choose from approaches the maximum number as modified in the Settings.\\nTo allow for natural learning development, we recommend parents to first pick just the colors the child already knows, and then gradually add new colors to be learned. At first, it is best when the child chooses only from two or three colors, and the range of targeted colors is enlarged subsequently.\\nBased on our two decades of experience in the educational field, we made every effort to make sure that the design of this app is as easy-to-use for this special age category as possible, and that the whole app is both fun and educational. We hope that your children will enjoy it the same way our little beta-testers did. Thank you for your purchase!',\n",

Score is progressively calculated, with more points for answering several times correctly in a row. The game ends after three sets of rounds composed of four pairs of animals each.\\n\\n2. Bingo! \\nWhen you have enabled the feature Tasks Read Aloud, the aim of the game is to tap on the picture of the animal, which was pronounced. The picture to be found is also displayed right next to the parrot, which will pronounce the task again when the child taps on the parrot.\\nIf the feature Tasks Read Aloud is disabled in the Settings, the game transforms to a reading game, where the child needs to tap on the animal picture, whose name is displayed.\\nThe game is completed once the child has filled the whole column or row with correct answers.\\n\\n3.

Once you make the correct match, a part of a hidden picture will be displayed as a reward!\\nIf you have enabled the feature Tasks Read Aloud, the child can tap on each card to hear the word pronounced, which transforms the game into a sounds memory game. The animals in the bottom right corner can be browsed through.\\n\\n4. Animatch!\\nAnimatch is a classic memory game, where you need to tap on one card, and uncover another card with the same picture. The goal is to match all cards. The name of the animal is always read aloud, so that children can better memorize the animal names. The game always has tree rounds, whose difficulty remains constant.

If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \\n\\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \\n****************************************** \\nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \\n\\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \\n\\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \\n****************************************** \\n\\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \\n\\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \\n\\nThank you for your purchase!\",\n",

              " 'EasterHunt is an interactive family devotional app for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.  EasterHunt is designed to help parents lead their children to the Gospel by using simple games and devotionals. It can be used as a once-a-day game to play for family devotional time, or can be played and read in larger portions.\\n\\nEasterHunt is designed with two sets of games: in the first game the child finds the egg by tapping around a park scene.  Background music plays while you search.  There are also some friendly animals that hop out and make cute sounds when you tap on their hiding place.  Once the egg is found, the “Open the Egg” game begins: the child then solves the puzzle by tapping the egg, shaking the egg, painting the egg, etc.  All the games are designed so a four year old can play them, and yet the games are engaging enough to be played over and over again, even by older kids.\\n\\nAfter opening the egg, a picture will appear along with a devotional that corresponds with the picture.  Each devotional will walk you through another aspect of the story of Easter and Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection.  This app is a great way for parents to stop and interact with their children in a fun and memorable way by reading the devotionals aloud.  With 12 separate devotionals, EasterHunt can be played as a 12 day countdown to Easter, or played in larger portions at one sitting.\\n\\nThere\\'s a very special treat for those that complete EasterHunt to the last level- they get to visit the empty tomb on Resurrection Day!  Enter into a 3D model of the tomb on your iPad or iPhone / iPod Touch and talk with the angels who will tell you that \"He is not here, for He is risen!\"\\n\\nThe options menu allows you to turn off the music and sound effects.  The level select menu allows you to replay a previous level as you “collect” the eggs in the Easter Basket.\\n\\nEasterHunt is designed for use with children between the ages of 2-10 years. With colorful artwork, simple games and short devotionals written in a narrative style, EasterHunt is sure to be something your kids look forward to playing, and not just at Easter time!\\n\\nEasterHunt can be used in a Sunday School classroom setting by simply connecting the iPad to a television through adapters available at an Apple Store or at other electronics retailers.\\n\\nThe full devotional text is available in a PDF for you to preview and print out at:\\nwww.squaresmith.com/easterhunt\\n\\nView videos of EasterHunt in action at:\\nwww.youtube.com/user/SquareSmithInc\\n\\nFollow EasterHunt on Facebook at:\\nwww.facebook.com/EasterHunt\\n\\nEasterHunt by SquareSmith\\nGame Design:  David and Jennie Smith\\nSoftware Development:  David Smith\\nArtwork:  Katey Cooper (www.katey-did.com)\\n3D Models:  Kelyn Crandall\\nDevotionals:  © 2012 Emilie K.

              " \"AbaCruX is a luxurious implementation of peg solitaire. We wanted to make something that looks attractive and is fun to keep around, because that used to be a main function of Peg Solitaire through the ages. It served as a marvelous coffee-table curiosity to entertain the occasional guest. Being the quintessence of a casual game we also wanted to avoid long load times. Like other single player games AbaCruX can be very relaxing. At the same time, however, it is also quite challenging and fantastic mental exercise. \\n\\nThis is a game for those who cherish a challenge, because these puzzles are not easy. One ball hops over the other to remove it from the board. Easy enough. Do that until there is only one ball left in a specific location. Done. But don't you expect to be able to solve each and every puzzle in an afternoon. Some of these configurations are very difficult to solve. The difficulty of a puzzle depends on the kind of board it uses and of course the initial constellation of its game pieces. But that's not all. In this game we play against the clock. So there is that. \\n\\nPlayers can switch boards and all of them hold their own secrets. Switching boards is encouraged and great exercise for getting better. Each board has a set of 15 puzzles in ascending difficulty. Each board's first configuration has already been unlocked. The rest of them have to be unlocked by solving each preceding puzzle with a score of 4 stars minimally. \\n\\nAltogether there are 8 boards in the basic game. Each with 15 puzzles. That is quite a bit of work. For those that would like more, there is an option to purchase an additional 8 boards. The package is called Extra Boards. It includes another 8 boards. These puzzles and boards are a bit more advanced. They are also quite beautiful in their complexity.\\n\\nSome configurations may be difficult to play on some of the smaller devices. That is unfortunately due to physical limitations. We hope that the availability of the game other devices like a Mac, iPad or Apple TV may mitigate this circumstance. \\n\\nGameCenter is a new addition and includes a full secondary scoring system. This one is built on points and allows competition between players. This system takes moves and time taken into account. But it is entirely optional.\\n\\n\\nNew Features\\n• play against the clock\\n• positional audio\\n• many more puzzles\\n• solutions are available\\n• GameCenter integration\\n• includes iOS, iPadOS, tvOS and macOS apps\\n\\nPlease note that some of the images shown may illustrate add-on functionality not available with the basic version of the app. Any in-app purchases are automatically available on all platforms.\",\n",

Play alone or with a friend.\\n\\nGems are randomly placed in plots of land made up of squares of grass.

If you\\'re not familiar with the rules of Mahjong Solitaire game, the this app is a good introduction, because this app is easy to play. The difficulty level of this app is for all levels, although most of the levels are for \"beginner\" to \"intermediate.\" The easy levels (boards layout) are fairly simple, the stacks of tiles are short and the number of tiles to match are not overwhelming.\\n\\nThe rules of the game is simple:\\n- You are presented with the game board, containing stacked tiles, forming structures such as the so-called \"pyramid\" or \"turtle\" solitaire board, tower-like stacks and others. \\n- To win the game, all the tiles much be removed from the board by matching them.\\n- Tiles can be matched if they have the same face/picture, under the condition that the tile is not blocked. \\nA tile is not blocked if it can slide to the left, right, or both, and there\\'s no tiles above it.\\n- You lose the game when the board has not been cleared and there\\'s no more tiles that can be moved.\\n\\nSounds simple? Then start playing. But prepare for some challenges, because Mahjong Solitaire is an easy to learn game that can be hard to master. You need to think ahead and chose which tiles to match carefully. Sometime the best move is the one that will free more matching tiles and not the most obvious ones. Sometime you\\'ll just have to try your luck because the tile underneath the matching tile is blocked. \\n\\nAs mentioned, it can be challenging not to not end up with tile(s) that are not \"free,\" which cause the board to be in an unsolvable state (dead-end). This can occur when all the matching tiles are covered by other tiles or if they can\\'t be moved because there\\'s a tile blocking its sides or covering above it.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Colorful Easter eggs themed variations of popular Solitaire Mahjong game. Instead of matching numbers and bamboos and dragons, you\\'re matching pictures of painted Easter eggs.\\n- Contains many boards for beginners and casual players alike.\\n- The boards are for various Mahjongg skill levels, beginners to intermediate. The traditional/classic turtle/pyramid board tower is included. \\n- Easy touch interface, just tap a tile then that another tile that matched it.\\n- Hint option to highlight matching Mahjongg tiles (if there\\'s a match possible).\\n- Shuffle options to assist when reaching a dead end. This will \"free\" some of the previously blocked tiles. But use sparingly because the number of Shuffles is limited.\\n- Cheerful graphics and soothing background music.\\n- Every board (level) is generated with a special algorithm. No game is ever the same; and even though your moves may make a board unsolvable, every board starts with a solvable configuration.\\n\\nWorks on phone and tablets. Best experienced on tablets.',\n",

              " \"This game teaches how evolution works: quirkies evolve through natural selection, reproduction, recombination and mutation of genes.\\n\\nThe basics: by selecting mates who get to reproduce, you and other players simulate the environment in which the best quirkies survive.  \\n\\nYou can choose a trait that you would like the population to have (do this on the settings screen). As you play the game, try to select quirkies with that trait. In each generation, the offspring inherit the genes from the parents. The trait that you picked will become common throughout the population. Your fitness score at the top of the main screen will improve, and you win the game with high enough fitness over generations. But quirkies might also be rejected by mates, experience harmful mutations, and risk extinction.\\n\\nAs you play, quirkies will entertain you with funny comments (even with speech), quiz your understanding of evolution, and make suggestions from an amazing range of educational videos and podcasts. Earn badges through these activities!\\n\\nYour quirkies will evolve new traits such as colors, nose, mouth, limbs, hair, and more by regulatory gene adaptations. Explore it all through the family tree (showing how genes are inherited) and population view. \\n\\nYou can also earn survival points with mini-games: help your offspring feed, fight challengers, and find their parents. And don't tell anyone, but if you get to the biolab, you can manipulate your quirkie's genes!\\n\\nEvolved a really cute quirkie? You can give it a name (it will also get a scientific species name), save it for later, and share it with your friends! (Parents, no worries --- your kid cannot post on social media without your permission.) You can get news updates, when one of your quirkies has new siblings or offspring. And then you can explore the families of your quirkies: their parents, siblings, mates, and offspring. \\n\\nIris Menczer (4th grade) and her dad created this game for kids to have fun learning about evolution. Evolutionary biologists have helped make it more educational. Hope you enjoy both the fun and the learning!\",\n",

              " 'Just put all clues into imaginary empty table and define column of specified element!\\nDo it in your mind.\\n\\nIt is a highly effective and versatile training simulator for brain - \"Genius Brain\". Its training effect is based on the need to make massive manipulations with the elements of the playing table in mind.\\n\\n\"Genius Brain\" intensively develops:\\n\\n- analytical thinking\\n- accuracy of thinking\\n- both short-term and long-term memory\\n- focus\\n- imagination and creativity\\n\\nRead more about the simulator.\\n\\nFor each new task, the game table is filled with elements in a random order, but their location is not shown to the user. The clues are shown - a pair of elements and a sign between them. The clue tells how the two elements are located in the table relative to each other. Clues are of several types, for example:\\n\\n\"Left\" - indicated by an arrow pointing to the left, and means that the column of the first clue element is located in the table directly to the left of the column of the second element;\\n\\n\"Neighbors\" - indicated by a double-headed arrow, and means that the clue elements are in the adjacent columns of the game table, but which one is on the left, and which on the right is unknown;\\n\\n\"In one column\" is indicated by an equal sign, and means that the clue elements are strictly in any one column of the game table;\\n\\n\"In a specific column\" is also denoted by an equal sign, but the second clue element is the number of the column in which the first clue element is located.\\n\\nDespite the unusual shape, the \"Genius Brain\" can be considered an ordinary classic puzzle when parts of an image need to be put together. Each clue in the \"Genius Brain\" is one of these parts. Therefore, the player’s goal is to place all clues in an empty (imaginary) table at the same time. After that, the only possible column of the table will be found, in which the element indicated at the bottom of the playing field can be located. This number must be entered at the bottom of the playing field. And it\\'s all. If you are not mistaken, you have solved the problem.\\n\\nSolving the first tasks in the mind can be a serious challenge. Therefore, I recommend using a pencil and paper at the initial stage. But as soon as you get comfortable, I highly recommend solving problems in your mind. It is then that the \"Genius Brain\" will reveal its powerful training potential. Solve problems regularly, increase the complexity of the game and the size of the table, and you will feel how your mind is growing uncontrollably!',\n",

              " \"What is TaleBlazer? Developed by the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program (STEP) lab, TaleBlazer is an augmented reality (AR) game platform which allows users to play and make their own location-based mobile games.   Want to make your own TaleBlazer game?  Visit us at taleblazer.org.\\n\\nTaleBlazer games take place in the real world. Players interact with virtual characters, objects, and data as they move around their real location. TaleBlazer games can be played on most smartphones. Once a game is downloaded to your smartphone, you don't need an internet connection to play your games.\\n\\nOrganizations such as zoos, nature centers, historic locations, living history museums, schools, universities, and many others can use augmented reality games to engage visitors deeply with their real-world environment. TaleBlazer games usually take place outside using GPS for positioning.  But TaleBlazer games can also take place inside using beacons or other game mechanics.\\n\\nWhy use TaleBlazer? TaleBlazer games can be compelling tools to engage players in thoughtful role-playing, exploration or investigation activities. Users can play AR games designed around nearly any subject. \\n\\nIn addition to playing games, users can make their own games. The process of making an AR game can also be educational and fun. The web-based TaleBlazer editor, which uses a blocks-based scripting language, makes it easy for anyone – including students - to make their own AR games. The ‘Support’ section of the website contains other resources and tutorials to get users started.\\n\\nAcknowledgements: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. AYS #0639638, ITEST #0833663 and AISL #1223407 awarded to the Missouri Botanical Garden and MIT.

So if you're already bored of Sudoku or crossword puzzles, you must try this hiper-addictive game. \\nAll puzzles have solution.

              " \"Kakuro CS is an easy to learn logic puzzle game which combines the excitement of crossword puzzles with the challenge of math and logic.  The game is very similar to Sudoku but adds a new twist; the numbers you enter in the cells must add up to the totals shown in the row and column headers.  Anyone can enjoy this challenging game, but If you've been playing Sudoku and are looking for a new challenge or if you like puzzles of math and logic, then these puzzles are perfect for you.\\n\\nKakuro (or Kakkuro - カックロ) is very popular in Japan, second only to Sudoku, although in other parts of the world, it is also referred to by the name 'Cross Sums' or 'Cross Addition'.   The puzzles are played in a grid of black and white cells and the object of the game is to completely fill in the while cells with numbers which meet the following requirements:\\n\\n1. Each white cell must be filled with a number from 1 to 9 inclusive\\n2. The sum of the numbers entered in each row and column must add up to the total for that row or column as indicated by the number in the black cells\\n3. You cannot use the same digit more than once in the same row or column\\n\\nWhile it is possible to solve these puzzles with a brute force approach, there is only one solution to each puzzle, so a better approach is to find the only combinations of numbers that can fit logically into the correct boxes.  For instance, if you have a vertical column with two boxes and a total of 3, the only possible numbers that can be used are 1 and 2, but which one goes in the box?   If the horizontal row that this box is in has 2 boxes in the row and a total of 4, then the only options in that row are 1, and 3.  Therefore, the only number that can be played in that box is the number 1.  By finding the combinations with the fewest possible choices and ruling out numbers that could not be used in the cells, it is possible to solve each puzzle without guessing.\\n\\nThe game includes Options such as:\\n* 'Auto-complete' - auto fills in the answer where only one possible answer can go.  For instance if you have a row with 2 cells in it and a total of 6, if you enter a 5 in one of the cells, this feature will automatically fill in the other box with a 1.   The game remembers that the cell is being auto filled, so if you change your entry from 5 to 4, the game auto enters a 2 in the other box instead.  If you're satisfied with the auto-completed cell, simply click on it and enter the number to lock it in.\\n* Auto-Notes Mode - With Auto-Notes Mode turned on, the game will fill in the possible numbers for each cell in the notes field of that cell and keep the possible numbers up to date with each change you make.\\n* 'Show Starting Hint' - If you need help starting a puzzle, the game will show you one row or column to get you started.\\n* 'Use Sounds' - A keyboard click sound is made each time you enter a number in a cell.  This can be turned off in the settings panel.\\n* 'Undo' - You can undo your moves all the way back to the beginning of the puzzle.  Be careful though, there is no Redo feature, so use this sparingly if you make a mistake and want to go back a few steps.\\n\\nWe're always working to improve our games and add new features.  Here are a few of the things we're working on for the next version:\\n - UI Customization (backgrounds, colors, etc)\\n - Multiple active games\\n - Social game features such as leaderboards and challenges with friends\",\n",

Originally invented for Belgian Mensa magazine Commensal, kaodokus offer a lot more variety than ordinary sudokus. Instead of numbers, the cells contain smiley faces which can have three possible shapes and three possible mouths. Each of the nine unique combinations has to appear exactly once in each column, row or other marked area just like in a normal sudoku. The big novelty is that in some cells only the mouth or shape is given, leaving the missing part for you to find. You can even ask for grids that initially don't include a single full symbol! This makes the puzzle experience a lot richer, requiring complex strategies combining bits and pieces of information in original ways.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Normal grids completely free, with as many randomly generated puzzles as you like in many different levels of difficulty.\\n- With a single in-app purchase, you can unlock more complex puzzles with extra diagonals, gray squares and chaotic grids which require even deeper thinking combining all those intersecting regions.\\n- Sophisticated hint system which actually suggests possible ways forward using step by step logic. Especially in the beginning this is very helpful since even the easiest kaodoku grids can be daunting for those not used to them.\\n- Activate pencil notes in the settings so you can zoom in and freely draw whatever doodles you like, just like you would on paper.\\n- Alternatively, you can also use standard candidate marks to keep track of the possible symbols in each cell. In very difficult puzzles, the hints function will take these candidate marks into account if they are the only way of making progress.\\n- Share puzzles with others, export them in pdf or png format, or print them on paper to solve them the old-fashioned way. Feel free to publish puzzles in magazines or on websites, as long as you don't remove the kaodoku web address.\",\n",

It is believed that this two-player board game originated as a popular form of recreation with both royalty and peasantry. But by the mid-13th century BC, Senet had evolved into a more religious ritual. Some depictions from this time period forward show the game being played not by two people, but rather as a deceased player competing against an invisible adversary, interpreted by some to symbolize the deceased players own soul.\\n\\nThe board has become a metaphor for the afterlife with pawns moving across the board just as a soul moves through layers of the netherworld after death. Reaching the final space and leaving the board is the goal of the game, just as reaching Horus and leaving the netherworld was the goal for the Egyptians after their death for attaining rebirth with the gods Isis & Osiris, Sekhmet & Bastet holding the Egyptian Ankh or the papyrus scepter.\\n\\nThe game board consists of 30 squares or slots, arranged in 3 horizontal rows of 10. Pawns move from left to right through row 1, then drop down and move from right to left through row 2. Dropping down again, pawns move from left to right along row 3 and finally, off the board. The game uses the rules of timothy kendall in his game, Passing Through the Netherworld :The Meaning and Play of Senet,an Ancient Egyptian Funerary Game.\\n\\nThe game includes five special squares, governed by their own rules, each containing a hieroglyphic. Square 15 is the House of Rebirth; square 26 is the House of Beauty; square 27 is the House of Water: square 28 is the House of the 3 Truths; square 29 is the House of 2 Truths; and square 30, the last, is the House of Horus,the Egyptian falcon-god and lord of the sky.\\n\\nEgyptian Senet is a pharaonic challenging game that combines luck,strategy,and magic features authentic photos of ancient Egyptian temples,plus artistically crafted graphics and animation of an ancient stone game board and pieces,set in an echoing,tomb-like chamber.Ritualistic music plus sound effects of stone pieces moving recreate the atmosphere of predynastic Egypt.The App\\'s Icon shows the Egyptian Queen Nefertari playing Senet in her tomb,she was the great wife of the pharaoh Ramesses II(Ramses)Rio. Also many Egyptian Queens have a similar photos playing Senet such as Cleopatra,Nefertiti the great royal wife of Akhenaten,and the Queen Hatshepsut the wife of Thutmose II.\\n\\nRecommended for everyone interested in Egyptology, Archeology, and Mummification.\\n\\nSupported Languages: (English Arabic French Spanish German Italian Dutch Russian Japanese Korean Chinese Portuguese-Brazil).',\n",

              " \"TL;DR: The app for unlimited solving of crosswords published online for Across Lite by major publishers and renowned authors.\\n\\nAcross Lite is hand-crafted with an eye for detail that only people who love both software and crosswords can create. Version 4 is state-of-the-art in features and aesthetics. \\n\\nSince 1995, more crosswords are published for Across Lite than any other format. Loyal users have enjoyed our software for decades. Whether you are a beginner or a fanatical expert, you will be able to enjoy the best in crosswords daily. \\n\\nIf you find published puzzles difficult, you can purchase our highly acclaimed trainer crossword series inside the app.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION: Across Lite is the de facto standard for publishing crosswords on the web - from newspapers such as The New York Times to independent authors - free or with subscription. The app includes a set of bookmarks to some of the well-known sources crosswords published for Across Lite. Downloading crosswords into Across Lite is easy. Puzzles can be downloaded and available to solve even when offline.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS: People who have used Across Lite on any platform know there is nothing Lite about it. It has more user-friendly and advanced features than any other software out there.\\n\\nIn addition to Across Lite signature features that has set the standard such as pen and pencil modes, extensive check and reveal commands, or ink saver for printing, there are ground-breaking features that are much copied but never equaled:\\n\\n- For the traditionalists, the unique Page View mode allows you to view and solve the crossword just like a printed crossword, the closest you can come to solving on paper. The List View provides the conventional computer-like interface for the gamers. But here is the best part - with single taps you can instantaneously switch back and forth between them allowing a type of solving never before possible. Once you get used to solving like this, nothing less will do.\\n\\n- The app contains our original invention - SmartMove™ - which captures a method experts instinctively use to solve in a criss-cross manner leveraging previously entered letters. Use it for a while and you will develop that habit for fast and effective solving.\\n\\n- Because no two solvers are alike, the app provides the most flexible and customizable interfaces. Both left-handed and right-handed people can find a layout that caters to them.\\n\\nUPGRADE: We request serious solvers and those who appreciate our efforts to consider purchasing an upgrade from inside the app. The upgrade enables the following:\\n\\n-\\xa0An embedded web browser for easy downloading of puzzles\\n\\n- A timer for those who wish to measure themselves.\\n\\n- Ability to enter multiple characters for rebus puzzles.\\n\\n- A unique color and contrast setting feature designed to reduce eye strain from looking at the traditional white background (perhaps because we, at Litsoft, are getting older!). It can be customized to personal tastes and to light conditions, so for example, solving in the dark does not turn you into a lighthouse for your spouse.\\n\\nJust try it out and we are certain that over time you will discover and come to appreciate all the small touches we have embedded in the app.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\nNOTE about availability of crosswords: \\n\\n- This app is a solver for independent crosswords published online in Across Lite format. Other than any crosswords for sale inside the app, it is NOT a supplier of crosswords. \\n\\n- To respect a publishing site's terms of service and to avoid copyright infringement, it does NOT automatically fetch crosswords for you without visiting the site. Doing so is a violation of publisher copyrights and reputable software will not do this.\\n\\n- It does NOT guarantee availability of crosswords from publishers who make their own decisions on availability and access including charging for them on their web sites.\\n\\nIf there are any problems with the access to crosswords on any site, please contact the site directly.\",\n",

              " 'Dinosaurs lived on Earth millions of years ago, long before our ancestors emerged on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \\n\\nFeatures: \\n◦ Connect points by numbers or letters \\n◦ When points are connected, you will see the silhouette of a hidden picture \\n◦ Once all the points have been connected, you can color the picture \\n◦ Choosing a wrong symbol three times in a row will bring up a tip \\n◦ Blue, orange, green or pink stars make the game even more exciting \\n◦ Easy-to-use palette that allows you to put together your own unique set of colors \\n◦ Colored pictures automatically saved on closing the program\\n\\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.',\n",

              " 'Pachinko is a game that is somewhat similar to pinball machines in the United States. In Japan, Pachinko machines are used as gaming devices in Pachinko parlors, where people play to win prizes or money.   \\n\\nWe are THRILLED and honored that in Japan Pachinko had reached the #1 position in Top Games and #5 in Top Applications!\\n\\nThe original machines were totally mechanical.  Our game emulates the early mechanical models.  A bit of skill is involved to launch the ball to certain areas of the machine, but it also takes some luck to get the ball in a “wing” or “drop bucket” to receive a jackpot of balls from the bank.  For more information check out:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko\\n\\n\\nOn-Core Pachinko Features\\n- Classic Pachinko emulates the original mechanical Japanese machines from the 70’s and on.\\n- There are modes that control the starting number of balls, jackpots, and number of balls required to win the game.\\n- High Scores when playing in unlimited mode (Limited Balls = NO).\\n\\nHow to Play\\nTo play, move the lever downwards by swiping your finger over the lower section of the game from top to bottom and then lifting your finger to release the lever.  How far down you pull the lever will determine how much force is used to launch the ball.  The balls are launched up through the chute on the left and fall down from the top.  You hit a jackpot when your ball falls into a “wing”, “drop bucket” or the center section of the game.  The bank pays you with additional balls.  When a ball enters a wing or the center section of the game, one or more wings will open.  Wide open wings provide a much greater chance of a ball getting in to hit a jackpot.\\n\\nWhen you get a ball in the center where the surfer is, not only will you earn more balls, one, two or all four of the wings will open depending upon where the ball hits the wave.  Experiment with pulling the lever down different distances to learn how you can control the area into which the balls drop.\\n\\nSome users have reported that initially found the game a bit hard. We suggest that you go into the Settings and raise the \"Balls to Start\" and \"Ball Per Award\" to higher numbers.',\n",

Deluxe Review By AndroidRundown \\n\\nFallDown! Deluxe is a stylish new game in the ambiguously named falling ball genre. Is it worth having a ball?\\n\\nFallDown! Deluxe is as simple to play as it is to comprehend. The player controls a ball rolling along a series of platforms with gaps that can be fallen into to advance. Meanwhile, a deadly ball cooking laser moves inexorably downwards all the while. The player must quickly roll the ball down gaps in each level of the playfield.\\n\\nAs the player advances, every 5 levels or so they reach the next level where gaps tend to be further away from each other, making it much harder to drop the ball in time.\\n\\nAfter the player inevitably gets roasted, collected currency can be used to purchase additional ball styles and backgrounds to spruce the game up a bit.\\n\\nFallDown! Deluxe looks nice. There are plenty of trippy colours and sparkly backgrounds that only become moreso after a few purchases. The frame rate is solid and there are no extraneous ads or anything else to get in the way of the game. Some nice techno music adds a lot to the game as well.\\n\\nReviews:\\n\\nSemplicemente divertente Passatempo ben fatto! Adatto allo svago. La semplicità è il suo punto di forza... Divertente!
